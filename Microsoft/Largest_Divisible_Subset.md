# Largest Divisible Subset
## https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-divisible-subset/

Given a set of distinct positive integers nums, return the largest subset answer such that every pair (answer[i], answer[j]) of elements in this subset satisfies:
    answer[i] % answer[j] == 0, or
    answer[j] % answer[i] == 0
If there are multiple solutions, return any of them.
- Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2]
- Explanation: [1,3] is also accepted.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,4,8]
Output: [1,2,4,8]

    This is the variation of the Longest Increasing Subsequence question
    Intuition : Get the longest series of numberb which are divisble in themselves, also the question is asking about the subset so we can think of sorting than applying LIS for checking the increasing order as well as we can check for divisiblity
